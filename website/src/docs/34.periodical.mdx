# Periodicals - EXPERIMENTAL

## Work Periodical

Lets fetch a periodical work. This periodical contains hundreds of issues,
we are able to paginate through issues with offset and limit.

Each issue contains a list of works, which we are also able to paginate through.

The same goes for subjects which may contain thousands of entries - pagination is supported.

<InlineGraphiQL
  query={`query GetPeriodicaByWork($id: String!, $issuesLimit: Int!, $worksLimit: Int!) {
  work(id: $id) {
    titles {
      full
    }
    extendedWork {
      ... on Periodical {
        issues {
          hitcount
          entries(limit: $issuesLimit) {
            display
            works(limit: $worksLimit) {
              workId
              titles {
                full
              }
            }
          }
          subjects {
            hitcount
            entries {
              term
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}`}

variables={{
  "id": "work-of:870970-basis:03261689",
  "issuesLimit": 5,
  "worksLimit": 2
}}
/>

## Work Article

Lets fetch an article. This article is part of some issue.
The following example shows how you retrieve all articles in that issue

<InlineGraphiQL
  query={`query GetIssueByWork($id: String!) {
  work(id: $id) {
    titles {
      full
    }
    extendedWork {
      ... on PeriodicalArticle {
        parentPeriodical {
          titles {
            main
          }
        }
        parentIssue {
          hitcount
          display
          works {
            workId
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}`}

variables={{
  "id": "work-of:870971-tsart:140062715"
}}
/>
