# Search

The following examples show how to search for bibliographic works.

## A Basic Example

A search request takes a query string as input and returns a list of works.
In this simple example we search for _harry_ and ask for work titles to be returned.
Note how _all_ in the query object is used to hold the query string. This is
useful when one does not know if the query matches a title, a creator or a subject.

<InlineGraphiQL
  query={`query Example_BasicSearch ($q: SearchQuery!, $offset: Int!, $limit: PaginationLimit!) {
      search(q: $q) {
        works(offset: $offset, limit: $limit) {
          titles {
            main
          }
        }
      }
    }`}
  variables={{ q: { all: "harry" }, offset: 0, limit: 10 }}
/>

## Pagination

In the example above, only 10 works are returned, but what if we want to browse the entire search
result?

For this purpose one needs to provide the _hitcount_ which indicates the total number of works in the result, and
to provide _offset_ and _limit_ which specify some slice of the result to be returned.

If one wants to show 10 works per page, the limit is set to 10 (the max limit size is 100). The first
page is selected by setting _offset_ to 0, the second page is selected by setting _offset_ to 10 and so on.
The total number of pages is calculated by dividing _hitcount_ with _limit_.

The example below returns the second page of the search result.

<InlineGraphiQL
  query={`query Example_SearchPagination ($q: SearchQuery!, $offset: Int!, $limit: PaginationLimit!) {
      search(q: $q) {
        hitcount
        works(offset: $offset, limit: $limit) {
          titles {
            main
          }
        }
      }
    }`}
  variables={{ q: { all: "harry" }, offset: 10, limit: 10 }}
/>

## Search For Title, Creator, and Subject

When it is known in advance that the search string is a title, a creator or a subject,
it may be specified in the query object _q_. Combinations are possible as well, for example by
implementing the UI with multiple input fields.

This example searches for _hopper_ as title, _hesteavl_ as subject, and _carl_ as creator.

<InlineGraphiQL
  query={`query Example_MultipleQSearch ($q: SearchQuery!, $offset: Int!, $limit: PaginationLimit!) {
    search(q: $q) {
      hitcount
      works(offset: $offset, limit: $limit) {
        titles {
          main
        }
        creators {
          display
        }
        subjects {
          dbcVerified {
            display
            ... on SubjectText {
              language {
                display
                isoCode
              }
            }
            type
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }`}
  variables={{
    q: { title: "hopper", subject: "hesteavl", creator: "carl" },
    offset: 0,
    limit: 10,
  }}
/>

## Faceted Search and Filters

Faceted search seeks to provide an improved overview by clustering the search result into
categories. This allows for the user to incrementally customize and narrow down the search result.

The following example is a search for _andersen_ where facet categories _mainLanguages_ and _materialTypes_
are returned.

<InlineGraphiQL
  query={`query Example_SearchFacets ($q: SearchQuery!, $facets: [FacetField!]!, $facetLimit: Int!) {
      search(q: $q) {
        hitcount
        facets(facets: $facets) {
          name
          values(limit: $facetLimit) {
            term
            score
          }
        }
      }
    }`}
  variables={{
    q: {
      all: "harry",
    },
    facetLimit: 5,
    facets: ["mainLanguages", "materialTypes"],
  }}
/>

Afterwards, the term of the facet can be used as a filter. In this example, a language filter
is applied resulting in an updated facet result.

<InlineGraphiQL
  query={`query Example_SearchFilters ($q: SearchQuery!, $facets: [FacetField!]!, $facetLimit: Int!, $filters: SearchFilters!) {
      search(q: $q, filters: $filters) {
        hitcount
        facets(facets: $facets) {
          name
          values(limit: $facetLimit) {
            term
            score
          }
        }
      }
    }`}
  variables={{
    q: {
      all: "harry",
    },
    filters: { mainLanguages: ["Svensk"] },
    facetLimit: 5,
    facets: ["mainLanguages", "materialTypes"],
  }}
/>

If multiple filters are added for the same category, they are OR'ed together.
For instance, _works_ must be Svensk OR Engelsk. Filters applied across categories
are AND'ed together. For instance (Svensk OR Engelsk) AND dvd.

## Facet performance :warning:

While it is possible to fetch both _facets_ and _works_ in a single request, it is not recommended.
Compared to getting the _works_, _facets_ are more expensive to generate.

Split the search for _works_ and _facets_ into two requests and send them in parallel. Then the _works_
can be shown to the user as quickly as possible.

## Intelligent Facets

The _IntelligentFacets_ field differs from the normal _facets_ field in that it does not take any arguments.
I.e. you do not specify the facets you want to be returned, instead it is automatically decided based on
the end users input (the query and selected filters).

<InlineGraphiQL
  query={`query Example_IntelligentFacets ($q: SearchQuery!, $facetsLimit: Int!, $valuesLimit: Int!) {
    search(q: $q) {
      hitcount
      intelligentFacets(limit: $facetsLimit) {
        name
        values(limit: $valuesLimit) {
          key
          term
          score
        }
      }
    }
  }`}
  variables={{
    q: {
      all: "harry",
    },
    facetsLimit: 5,
    valuesLimit: 5,
  }}
/>

## Did You Mean

You can fetch a list of alternative _did you mean_ queries. The user may have misspelled
something, which results in a low number of results, or results that are not useful.

The score is a value between 0 and 1 and can be used to determine if a query suggestion
should be displayed.

<InlineGraphiQL
  query={`query Example_DidYouMean($q: SearchQuery!, $limit: Int) {
  search(q: $q) {
    didYouMean(limit: $limit) {
      query
      score
    }
  }
}`}
  variables={{
    q: {
      all: "Anders Mathesen",
    },
    limit: 3,
  }}
/>

## Holdings Filters

In the following example we only include works that are on the shelf in a specific branch.

<InlineGraphiQL
  query={`query Example_HoldingsFilters ($q: SearchQuery!, $offset: Int!, $limit: PaginationLimit!, $filters: SearchFilters!) {
  search(q: $q, filters: $filters) {
    hitcount
    works(offset: $offset, limit: $limit) {
      titles {
        main
      }
    }
    facets(facets: [workTypes]) {
      name
      values(limit: 10) {
        key
        term
        score
      }
    }
  }
}`}
  variables={{
    q: {
      all: "Harry",
    },
    filters: { branchId: ["775122"], status: ["OnShelf"] },
    offset: 0,
    limit: 5,
  }}
/>
