# Complex Search

Complex search has support for CQL queries.

Currently, it uses simplesearch under the hood. The CQL query is handled as q.all,
meaning you can't actually use the CQL syntax and expect to get something meaningful back.

<InlineGraphiQL
  query={`query ($cql: String!, $offset: Int!, $limit: PaginationLimit!, $filters: ComplexSearchFilters!) {
  complexSearch(cql: $cql, filters: $filters) {
    hitcount
    works(offset: $offset, limit: $limit) {
      titles {
        main
      }
    }
  }
}`}
  variables={{
    cql: "Harry",
    filters: { branchId: ["775122"], status: ["OnShelf"] },
    offset: 0,
    limit: 5,
  }}
/>
