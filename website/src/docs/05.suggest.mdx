# Suggest

A list of suggestions can be returned by providing a query in the following way.

The value of the _term_ field
can be used to make a [search request](#Search).

The _type_ field indicates whether
the suggestion is a title, a creator, a subject, or a composit (a combination of title and creator).
This can be used to explicitly search for a [title, creator or subject](#Search-For-Title,-Creator,-and-Subject).

The value of the _work_ field is a work that will be a top hit in the search result based
on the corresponding _term_.

The following example gets suggestions for all agencies. Note that you can specify suggestion types,
in this example subjects and creators are returned.

<InlineGraphiQL
  query={`query Example_Suggestions ($q: String!, $suggestTypes: [SuggestionType!]) {
  suggest(q: $q, suggestTypes: $suggestTypes) {
    result {
      type
      term
      work {
        titles {
          main
        }
      }
    }
  }
}`}
  variables={{
    q: "harry",
    suggestTypes: ["SUBJECT", "CREATOR"],
  }}
/>

## Local Suggestions

When using the 'localSuggest' query, results are limited to the agency associated with your access token.

The branchId parameter can be used to further limit suggestions to a specific branch within that agency.
The value of _branchId_ is a string that must be the id of one of the branches.

This example assumes that you have an access token for Aarhus.

<InlineGraphiQL
  query={`query Example_LocalSuggestions ($q: String!, $branchId: String!) {
  localSuggest(q: $q, branchId: $branchId) {
    result {
      type
      term
      work {
        titles {
          main
        }
      }
    }
  }
}`}
  variables={{
    q: "harry",
    branchId: "775122",
  }}
/>
