# VIP

This section provides examples for retrieving agency information and Opensearch profiles using VIP.

The `status` field can be one of the following enum values

<DescribeEnum name="VipResponseStatusEnum" />

## Agency Information

In this example, we are fetching basic information about agencies located in **Herlev**.
The query filters results based on the `city` field. Additionally, you can filter by other available
fields such as `agencyId`, `postalCode`, `libraryType`, and more to refine the search results.

### Example: Fetching Agencies by City

The following query fetches agency details for all agencies located in the city of **Herlev**.
It retrieves fields such as the agency's ID, city, CVR number, and branch names (available in different languages).

<InlineGraphiQL
  query={`query ExampleVipAgencyInfo($city: String!) {
  vip {
    agencyInfo(city: $city) {
      status
      result {
        pickupAgency {
          agencyId
          city
          agencyCvrNumber
          branchName {
            language
            value
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}`}
  variables={{
    city: "herlev",
  }}
/>

## Opensearch Profiles

VIP also allows you to retrieve Opensearch profiles associated with specific agencies.
Each profile can include multiple sources, which represent searchable databases or collections associated with the profile.

In this example we fetch the list of Opensearch Profiles that belong to the agency 716300.
It is also possible to retrieve the list of sources for each profile

### Example: Fetching Opensearch Profiles by Agency ID

In the query below, we are fetching the Opensearch profiles for the agency with ID 716300.
This query returns the names of the profiles. You can also extend the query to retrieve the sources for each profile.

<InlineGraphiQL
  query={`query ExampleVipOpensearchProfile($agencyId: String!) {
    vip {
    opensearchProfiles(agencyId: $agencyId) {
      status
      result {
        profileName
      }
    }
  }
}`}
  variables={{
    agencyId: "716300",
  }}
/>

## Automation parameters

VIP allows you to fetch Ill parameters defining what type of materials to be handled automatically

### Example: Fetching ill parameters by AgencyId

<InlineGraphiQL
  query={`query ExampleVipAutomationParameters($agencyId: String!) {
    vip {
    autoIll(agencyId: $agencyId) {
      automationParams {
        provider
        materials {
          name
          willProvide
        }
      }
    }
  }
}`}
  variables={{
    agencyId: "710100",
  }}
/>

## Request Order

Returns a prioritized list of library numbers that the given library should order from.

### Example: Fetching requestOrder list by AgencyId

<InlineGraphiQL
  query={`query ExampleVipRequestOrder($agencyId: String!) {
    vip {
    requestOrder(agencyId: $agencyId){
      agencyIds
    }
  }
}`}
  variables={{
    agencyId: "710100",
  }}
/>
