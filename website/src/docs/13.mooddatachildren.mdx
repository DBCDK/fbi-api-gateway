# Mood Data for Children

For a smaller collection of both fiction and nonfiction works for children we have added mood data to describe the works.
This data includes tags to describe the feeling you get from reading the book, information about how long/short the book is, how many illustrations the books has etc.
You can get recommendations based on mood data from this collection of works for children and search them as well.
