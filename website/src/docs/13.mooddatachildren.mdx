# Mood Data for Children

For a smaller collection of both fiction and nonfiction works for children we have added mood data to describe the works.
This data includes tags to describe the feeling you get from reading the book, information about how long/short the book is, how many illustrations the books has etc.
You can get recommendations based on mood data from this collection of works for children and search them as well.

## Work search children

Search works for children based on mood data.
A mood search request takes a query string as input and returns a list of works.
In this simple example we search for the mood 'sjov' and ask for work titles to be returned.
In this example we search in the field 'ALL'. This is useful when one does not know if the query matches a title, a creator or a mood.

In the search response, you'll notice that some subjects are accompanied by a rating.
Additionally, manifestations are enriched with multiple aspects of audience level.

<InlineGraphiQL
  query={`query Example_moodmatchkids($q: String!, $limit: PaginationLimit!, $offset: Int!, $field: MoodSearchFieldValues!) {
	mood {
  moodSearchKids(q: $q, field: $field) {
    works(offset: $offset, limit: $limit) {
      workId
      titles {
        main
      }
	  subjects {
		dbcVerified {

}`}
  variables={{
    q: "sjov",
    limit: 10,
    offset: 0,
    field: "ALL",
  }}
