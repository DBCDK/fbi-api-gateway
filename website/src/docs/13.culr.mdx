# Culr

CULR (_Core User Library Registry_) receives local user identifiers from affiliated
data providers (eg. libraries) and assigns a global user id (_GUID_) for each unique user.

## CreateAccount

Creates an account in culr based on a CPR validated user. Only FFU libraries which supports **Borchk** can be created using this mutation field.

⚠️ If the _dryRun_ argument is set to true. The actual service will never get called, but will return a status "OK".

The returned _status_ can be one of the following:

- _**OK**_ - Account was successfully created
- _**ERROR**_ - Account was not created - Some unknown error occured
- _**ERROR_INVALID_CPR**_ - CPR input was not recognized as a CPR
- _**ERROR_INVALID_AGENCY**_ - AgencyId input was not recognized as a valid FFU Agency
- _**ERROR_UNAUTHENTICATED_TOKEN**_ - An unauthenticated token was used
- _**ERROR_USER_ALREADY_CREATED**_ - Account already exist
- _**ERROR_LOCALID_NOT_UNIQUE**_ - LocalId is already in use
- _**ERROR_AGENCYID_NOT_PERMITTED**_ - AgencyId input is out of permission scope
- _**ERROR_NO_AUTHORISATION**_ - Credentials could not be authorized

<InlineGraphiQL
  query={`
    mutation Example_CreateAccount($input: CreateAccountInput!) {
        culr {
            createAccount(input: $input, dryRun: true) {
                status
            }
        }
    }
`}
  variables={{
    input: {
      agencyId: "800010",
      localId: "C012345678",
      cpr: "0123456789",
    },
  }}
/>

## DeleteAccount

Delete an account in culr based on a localId. Only FFU libraries which supports Borchk can be deleted using this mutation field.

⚠️ If the _dryRun_ argument is set to true. The actual service will never get called, but will return a status "OK".

The returned _status_ can be one of the following:

- _**OK**_ - Account was successfully deleted
- _**ERROR**_ - Account was not deleted - Some unknown error occured
- _**ERROR_INVALID_AGENCY**_ - AgencyId input was not recognized as a valid FFU Agency
- _**ERROR_UNAUTHENTICATED_TOKEN**_ - An unauthenticated token was used
- _**ERROR_ACCOUNT_DOES_NOT_EXIST**_ - The account which was requested for deleting does not exist
- _**ERROR_AGENCYID_NOT_PERMITTED**_ - AgencyId input is out of permission scope
- _**ERROR_NO_AUTHORISATION**_ - Credentials could not be authorized

<InlineGraphiQL
  query={`
    mutation Example_DeleteAccount($input: DeleteAccountInput!) {
        culr {
            deleteAccount(input: $input, dryRun: true) {
                status
            }
        }
    }
`}

    input: {
      agencyId: "800010",
      localId: "C012345678",
    },
  }}
/>

## GetAccountsByLocalId

Get all culr accounts by a users localId. All Agencies linked to the user is returned.

If no account (_GUID_) was found, `getAccountsByLocalId` will return _null_

All libraries are supported.

<InlineGraphiQL
  query={`
    mutation Example_GetAccountsByLocalId($input: GetAccountsByLocalIdInput!) {
        culr {
            getAccountsByLocalId(input: $input) {
                municipalityNo
                guid

                    userIdValue
                }
            }
        }
    }
