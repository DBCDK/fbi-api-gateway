# BIBDK Delete Order

Delete an order which has been placed with the submitOrder mutation.

It is possible to delete an order at any agency the user is registered.
The example sets dryRun:true, which prevents the deletetion query from actually being executed against openuserstatus.
If omitted, dryRun is sat to false.

<InlineGraphiQL
  query={`mutation cancelOrder($orderId: String!, $agencyId: String!) {
  deleteOrder(orderId: $orderId, agencyId: $agencyId, dryRun: true) {
    deleted
    error
  }
}`}
  variables={{ orderId: "78434523", agencyId: "715100" }}
/>
