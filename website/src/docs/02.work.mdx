# Work

A work is some creation like a book, article, movie etc. It may exist in many different variants -
in the API we call these manifestations. For instance, a book may be available in multiple physical
and online variants or manifestations. And a movie could be streamed online or maybe borrowed on DVD
or Blu-ray. The work data, then, is the data that is common for all manifestations in the work.

In the following examples, we show how to get metadata for a work and for its manifestations.

## The Basics of a Work

Different user interfaces have different needs, hence we offer several ways to fetch metadata.
E.g. if you don’t need a lot of flexibility, fields named “display” or “summary” contain the
most important information while hiding complexity.

For example when fetching data based on a time period, the display could be “1980 - 1989". But users can also just use the
“begin” or “end” field separately to return a wider result. Likewise, a list of subjects can
easily be shown by using the “display” field, but if the subject is for instance a person,
detailed fields like “lastname”, “nameSort” and “birthYear” are available for more precision.

In the following example, often-used fields are fetched in the simplest way possible.

<InlineGraphiQL
  query={`query Example_BasicWork ($id: String!) {
  work(id: $id) {
    workId
    titles {
      full
    }
    abstract
    creators {
      display
    }
    subjects {
      dbcVerified {
        display
        ... on SubjectText {
          language {
            display
            isoCode
          }
        }
        type
      }
    }
    workYear
    workTypes
    mainLanguages {
      display
    }
    manifestations {
      latest {
        cover {
          detail
        }
      }
    }
  }
}`}
  variables={{
    id: "work-of:870970-basis:48953786",
  }}
/>

## Work Identifiers

A work is identified by a _work id_, _pid_, or _faust_. It can also be found with an _oclc_ (identifier from library of congress) and either of them can be used to
fetch a work.

<InlineGraphiQL
  query={`query Example_WorkByFaust ($faust: String!) {
      work(faust: $faust) {
        workId
      }
    }`}
  variables={{
    faust: "40754563",
  }}
/>

<InlineGraphiQL
  query={`query Example_WorkByPid ($pid: String!) {
      work(pid: $pid) {
        workId
      }
    }`}
  variables={{
    pid: "870970-basis:40754563",
  }}
/>

<InlineGraphiQL
  query={`query Example_WorkById ($id: String!) {
      work(id: $id) {
        workId
      }
    }`}
  variables={{
    id: "work-of:870970-basis:48953786",
  }}
/>

<InlineGraphiQL
  query={`query Example_WorkByOclc ($oclc: String!) {
      work(oclc: $oclc) {
        workId
      }
    }`}
  variables={{
    oclc: "1263675959",
  }}
/>

## Fetch List of Works

It is possible to fetch multiple works in a single request by providing
a list of identifiers. The identifiers may be _a list of work ids_, _a list of pids_, _a list of fausts_ or _a list of oclc_.

The order of these works will match the order of the identifiers that are provided.
If no work is found as an identifier, null is returned at the corresponding position.

<InlineGraphiQL
  query={`query Example_MultipleWorks ($faust: [String!]!) {
      works(faust: $faust) {
        workId
      }
    }`}
  variables={{
    faust: ["48953786", "61965815", "unknown-faust"],
  }}
/>

## Relations

The _relations_ field can be used to look up other manifestations that are related to
this work/manifestation.

<InlineGraphiQL
  query={`query Example_WorkRelations ($id: String!) {
  work(id: $id) {
    workId
    titles {
      main
    }
    relations {
      isReviewOf {
        titles {
          main
        }
      }
    }
  }
}`}
  variables={{
    id: "work-of:870970-basis:51701763",
  }}
/>

## Reviews

This example shows how to get the reviews of a work.

A review is just a _Manifestation_, meaning we can use the access field to get a list of
possible ways to access the content of the review. Check out access examples [here](#Manifestation-Access).

Note that if the review is created by a librarian (materialevurdering), the actual sections of the
review is available on the manifestation at the path _review.reviewByLibrarians_.

<InlineGraphiQL
  query={`query Example_WorkReviews ($id: String!) {
  work(id: $id) {
    workId
    titles {
      main
    }
    relations {
      hasReview {
        pid
        creators {
          display
        }
        access {
          __typename
          ... on InfomediaService {
            id
          }
          ... on DigitalArticleService {
            issn
          }
        }
        hostPublication {
          title
          issue
        }
        physicalDescriptions {
          summary
        }
        review {
          rating
          reviewByLibrarians {
            content
            contentSubstitute
            heading
            type
            manifestations {
              pid
              titles {
                main
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}`}
  variables={{
    id: "work-of:870970-basis:51701763",
  }}
/>

### Librarians Review

A librarians review may refer to different manifestations. It is possible to insert links to these manifestations
located at your site. The field _review.reviewByLibrarians.contentSubstitute_ may contain pids that need to be substituted.
Relevant manifestations are found at the field _review.reviewByLibrarians.manifestations_, and you can get whatever
data you need to generate the links. If links are not required, use the field _review.reviewByLibrarians.content_, which
does not require substitution.

<InlineGraphiQL
  query={`query Example_LibrariansReview ($pid: String!) {
  manifestation(pid: $pid) {
    pid
    titles {
      main
    }
    review {
      rating
      reviewByLibrarians {
        content
        contentSubstitute
        heading
        type
        manifestations {
          pid
          titles {
            main
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}`}
  variables={{
    pid: "870976-anmeld:129103779",
  }}
/>

## <DeprecationTitle>Reviews</DeprecationTitle>

<DeprecationBorder>
  <DeprecationBox deprecated="01/03-2023" expires="01/06-2023">
    Please note that Field `Work.reviews` is deprecated and will be removed. Use
    `Work.relations.hasReview` instead. See [Reviews](#Reviews) documentation
    for details.
  </DeprecationBox>

<br />

The reviews field returns a list of reviews. Each review may be one of the following types:

- `InfomediaReview` includes an ID that can be used to look up the actual
  article. Check out the [Infomedia section](#Infomedia).
- `ExternalReview` includes a url to an external website where the review is located.
- `LibrariansReview` is a review made by Danish librarians - in Danish it's known as “lektørudtalelse” or “materialevurdering”.
  The entire review can be obtained from this object type, without the user being logged
  in, and consists of a list of content sections. A section may include a reference
  to another work. If so, the title of this referenced work should be appended to the
  text (preferably as a link).

The following example shows a librarians review with a reference to an external work
(in the last section of the response).

<InlineGraphiQL
  query={`query Example_Deprecated_ReviewsWithReference ($id: String!) {
  work(id: $id) {
    workId
    titles {
      main
    }
    reviews {
      __typename
      ... on LibrariansReview {
        author
        date
        sections {
          code
          heading
          text
          work {
            workId
            titles {
              main
            }
            creators {
              display
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}`}
  variables={{
    id: "work-of:870970-basis:51701763",
  }}
/>

<br />
<br />
In the following example you will find both external and infomedia reviews. Note
that some but not all of these reviews include a rating.

<InlineGraphiQL
  query={`query Example_Deprecated_Reviews ($id: String!) {
  work(id: $id) {
    workId
    titles {
      main
    }
    reviews {
      __typename
      author
      date
      ... on ExternalReview {
        rating
        urls {
          origin
          url
        }
      }
      ... on InfomediaReview {
        id
        rating
      }
    }
  }
}`}
  variables={{
    id: "work-of:870970-basis:53969127",
  }}
/>

</DeprecationBorder>

## Series

A work may be part of one or more series. The example below fetches the series title,
some information about how the work itself fits inside the series and all members of the serie as works.

Currently series is divided into two main categories, `PUBLISHER_SERIES` and `REGULAR_SERIES`.
This Series field will only return `REGULAR_SERIES`.

<InlineGraphiQL
  query={`query Example_WorkSeries ($workId: String!) {
  work(id: $workId) {
    series {
    	title
      numberInSeries {
        display
        number
      }
      readThisFirst
      readThisWhenever
      members {
              work {
                workId
                titles {
                  full
                }
              }
            }
    }
  }
}`}
  variables={{
    workId: "work-of:870970-basis:52557240",
  }}
/>

## <DeprecationTitle>Series Members</DeprecationTitle>

<DeprecationBorder>
  <DeprecationBox deprecated="27/05-2023" expires="01/09-2023">
    Please note that Field `Work.seriesMembers` is deprecated and will be removed. Use
    `Work.series.members` instead. See [series](#Series) documentation
    for details.
  </DeprecationBox>

<br />

Fetch all the members (works) of a series that the referenced work is a member of,
including the work itself.

<InlineGraphiQL
  query={`query Example_SeriesMembers ($workId: String!) {
  work(id: $workId) {
    seriesMembers {
      titles {
        main
      }
    }
  }
}`}
  variables={{
    workId: "work-of:870970-basis:52557240",
  }}
/>
</DeprecationBorder>

## Universe

Some works may be part of a universe, like the "Harry Potter Universe" in this example.

<InlineGraphiQL
  query={`query Example_WorkUniverse ($workId: String!) {
  work(id: $workId) {
    universe {
      title
    }
  }
}`}
  variables={{
    workId: "work-of:870970-basis:27267912",
  }}
/>

## Translations

Some metadata may be available in English. Specify a language and we will
translate data where possible.

Only fields named _display_, _summary_ etc. may contain translations.

<InlineGraphiQL
  query={`query Example_WorkTranslations ($workId: String!, $language: LanguageCode) {
    work(id: $workId, language: $language) {
      mainLanguages {
        display
        isoCode
      }
    }
  }`}
  variables={{
    workId: "work-of:870970-basis:52557240",
    language: "en",
  }}
/>
