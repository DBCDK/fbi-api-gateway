# LinkCheck

## Checks

Validates a given list of urls, by returning an individual url `status`. Urls known by the service will return a cached status. Cached statuses are continuously checked on new requests.

The returned _status_ can be one of the following:

- _OK_
- _BROKEN_
- _INVALID_
- _GONE_

The field `brokenSince` will return a timestamp for when the link was first marked as _BROKEN_ or _GONE_. The `lastCheckedAt` field, will return a timestamp for when the url was last checked.
