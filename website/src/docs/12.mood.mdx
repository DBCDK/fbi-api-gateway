# Mood Data

For a smaller collection of mainly Danish Literature we have added mood data to describes the works.
This includes tags to describe the feeling you get from reading the book, or the pace of the narrative or the perspective from which the story is told.
You can search, get suggestions and recommendations based on this mood data collection.

## Search with mood data

A mood search request takes a query string as input and returns a list of works.
In this simple example we search for the mood 'uhyggelig' and ask for work titles to be returned.
In this example we search in the field 'ALL'.
This is useful when one does not know if the query matches a title, a creator or a mood.

<InlineGraphiQL
  query={`query Example_moodmatch($q: String!, $limit: PaginationLimitScalar!, $offset: Int!, $field: MoodSearchFieldValues!) {
  mood {
  	moodSearch(q: $q, field: $field) {
    works(offset: $offset, limit: $limit) {
      workId
      titles {
        main
      }
    }
  }
  }
}`}
  variables={{
    q: "uhyggelig",
    limit: 10,
    offset: 0,
    field: "ALL",
  }}
/>

## Suggestions with mood data

A list of suggestions based on mood data can be returned by providing a query in the following way.

The value of the _term_ field
can be used to make a [mood search request](#Search-with-mood-data).

The _type_ field indicates whether
the suggestion is a title, a creator, a (mood) tag.
This can be used to explicitly search for a [title, creator or mood tags](#Search-with-mood-data).

The value of the _work_ field is a work that will be a top hit in the search result based
on the corresponding _term_.

The following example gets suggestions for the string 'spændende'.

<InlineGraphiQL
  query={`query Example_moodSuggest($q: String!) {
	mood {
  moodSuggest(q: $q) {
    response {
      term
      work {
        workId
      }
      type
    }
  }}
}`}
  variables={{
    q: "spændende",
  }}
/>

## Tags Recommendations mood data

Get work recommendations from the mood data collection based on mood data. Input are mood data (tags).

<InlineGraphiQL
  query={`query Example_moodTagsRecommend($tags: [String!]!, $minus: [String!], $plus: [String!]) {
	mood {
  moodTagRecommend(tags: $tags, minus: $minus, plus: $plus) {
    work {
      workId
    }
    similarity
  }}
}`}
  variables={{
    tags: ["spændende", "uhyggelig", "sjov"],
    minus: ["spændende"],
    plus: ["komisk"],
  }}
/>

## Work Recommendations mood data

Get work recommendations from the mood data collection based on other works from the same collection. Input are liked works (workIds).

<InlineGraphiQL
  query={`query Example_MoodWorkRecommend($likes: [String!]!, $maxAuthorRecommendations: Int, $dislikes: [String!]) {
  mood {
    moodWorkRecommend(
      dislikes: $dislikes
      likes: $likes
      maxAuthorRecommendations: $maxAuthorRecommendations
    ) {
      work {
        creators {
          display
        }
        workId
      }
      similarity
    }
  }
}`}
  variables={{
    likes: ["work-of:870970-basis:38499386", "work-of:870970-basis:01362305"],
    dislikes: ["work-of:870970-basis:38499386"],
    maxAuthorRecommendations: 2,
  }}
/>
