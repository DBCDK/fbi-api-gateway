# BIBDK Renew Loan

Renew a loan through openuserstatus service.

It is possible to renew a loan at any agency the user is registered at.
The example sets dryRun:true, which prevents the renewal query from actually being executed against openuserstatus.
If omitted, dryRun is sat to false.

<InlineGraphiQL
  query={`mutation renewLoan($loanId: String!, $agencyId: String!) {
  renewLoan(loanId: $loanId, agencyId: $agencyId, dryRun: true) {
    renewed
    error
    dueDate
  }
}`}
  variables={{ loanId: "78434523", agencyId: "715100" }}
/>
