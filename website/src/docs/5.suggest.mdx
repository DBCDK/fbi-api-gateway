# Suggest

This is how to get suggestions given some query. The value of the _term_ field
can be used to make a [search request](#Search).

The _type_ field indicates whether
the suggestion is a title, creator, subject, or composit (a combination of title and creator).
This can be used to explicitly search for a [title, creator or subject](#Search-For-Title,-Creator,-and-Subject).

The _work_ field is a work that is related to the _term_ in some way.

## Lookup suggestions

Suggestions are filtered by the agency associated with your access token.

<InlineGraphiQL
  query={`query ($q: String!) {
  suggest(q: $q) {
    result {
      type
      term
      work {
        titles {
          main
        }
      }
    }
  }
}`}
  variables={{
    q: "harry",
  }}
/>

## Filter on branch name

The branch parameter can be used to limit suggestions to a specific branch. Name of the branch MUST be a valid branch name
for the agency associated with your access token. This example assumes that you have an access token for Ã¥rhus. 

<InlineGraphiQL
query={`query ($q: String!) {
suggest(q: $q branch:"Beder-Malling") {
result {
type
term
work {
titles {
main
}
}
}
}
}`}
variables={{
q: "harry",
}}
/>
