# Suggest

This is how to get suggestions given some query. The value of the _term_ field
can be used to make a [search request](#Search).

The _type_ field indicates whether
the suggestion is a title, creator, subject, or composit (a combination of title and creator).
This can be used to explicitly search for a [title, creator or subject](#Search-For-Title,-Creator,-and-Subject).

The value of the _work_ field is a work that will be a top hit in the search result based
on the corresponding _term_.

## Lookup suggestions

<InlineGraphiQL
  query={`query ($q: String!) {
  suggest(q: $q) {
    result {
      type
      term
      work {
        titles {
          main
        }
      }
    }
  }
}`}
  variables={{
    q: "harry",
  }}
/>

## Filter on branch name (local suggestions)

When using the 'localSuggest' query results are limited to the agency associated with your access token.

The branch parameter can be used to further limit suggestions to a specific branch. Name of the branch MUST be a valid branch name
for the agency associated with your access token. This example assumes that you have an access token for Aarhus.

<InlineGraphiQL
  query={`query ($q: String!) {
  localSuggest(q: $q branch:"Beder-Malling") {
    result {
      type
        term
        work {
          titles {
            main
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }`}
  variables={{
    q: "harry",
  }}
/>
