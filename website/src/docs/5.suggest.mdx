# Suggest

This is how to get suggestions given some query. The value of the _term_ field
can be used to make a [search request](#Search).

The _type_ field indicates whether
the suggestion is a title, creator, subject, or composit (a combination of title and creator).
This can be used to explicitly search for a [title, creator or subject](#Search-For-Title,-Creator,-and-Subject).

The _work_ field is a work that is related to the _term_ in some way.
