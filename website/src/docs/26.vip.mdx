# VIP

This section provides examples for retrieving agency information and Opensearch profiles using VIP.

## Agency Information

In this example, we are fetching basic information about agencies located in **Herlev**.
The query filters results based on the `city` field. Additionally, you can filter by other available
fields such as `agencyId`, `postalCode`, `libraryType`, and more to refine the search results.

### Example: Fetching Agencies by City

The following query fetches agency details for all agencies located in the city of **Herlev**.
It retrieves fields such as the agency's ID, city, CVR number, and branch names (available in different languages).

<InlineGraphiQL
  query={`query ExampleVipAgencyInfo($city: String!) {
  vip {
    agencyInfo(city: $city) {
      pickupAgency {
        agencyId
        city
        agencyCvrNumber
        branchName {
          language
          value
        }
      }
    }
  }
}`}
  variables={{
    city: "herlev",
  }}
/>

## Opensearch Profiles

VIP also allows you to retrieve Opensearch profiles associated with specific agencies.
Each profile can include multiple sources, which represent searchable databases or collections associated with the profile.

In this example we fetch the list of Opensearch Profiles that belong to the agency 716300.
It is also possible to retrieve the list of sources for each profile

### Example: Fetching Opensearch Profiles by Agency ID

In the query below, we are fetching the Opensearch profiles for the agency with ID 716300.
This query returns the names of the profiles. You can also extend the query to retrieve the sources for each profile.

<InlineGraphiQL
  query={`query ExampleVipOpensearchProfile($agencyId: String!) {
  vip {
    opensearchProfiles(agencyId: $agencyId) {
      profileName
    }
  }
}`}
  variables={{
    agencyId: "716300",
  }}
/>
