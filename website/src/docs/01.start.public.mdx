# Get started :coffee:

Welcome to the documentation page of the FBI API.

The API is powered by GraphQL, learn about that [here](https://graphql.org/learn).

On this page you will be able to get an overview of the API. We have included a
bunch of examples, which you can modify right in the browser.

You need to _configure access_ to see the examples, and you will need an access token to do so.
Read on, and learn how to get one.

## How to get access?

You can get usage rights to FBI-API if you have access to FBI (FÃ¦lles BiblioteksInfastruktur), which is governed by KOMBIT.
Currently only Danish libraries can get access to the API. So, in order to get started, you will need an agreement with a library.

1. First of all, you need to obtain a _CLIENT_ID_ and a _SECRET_ for your application/project

   Send a request via [customer support](https://kundeservice.dbc.dk) and include the following information:

   - Project owner (library, email, phone)
   - Technical contact person (name, email, phone)
   - Name and description of the application/project

2. Obtain an access token

   Get an _anonymous access token_ to access the API on behalf of the application:

   ```
   curl --user "${CLIENT_ID}:${CLIENT_SECRET}" -X POST https://login.bib.dk/oauth/token -d "grant_type=password&username=@&password=@"
   ```

   Or get an _authenticated access token_ to access the API on behalf of an end user.

   ```
   curl --user "${CLIENT_ID}:${CLIENT_SECRET}" -X POST https://login.bib.dk/oauth/token -d "grant_type=password&username=${USERNAME}&password=${PASSWORD}"
   ```

   `${USERNAME}` is Loanernumber@library-agencyId and `${PASSWORD}` is the end user's pincode.

3. Begin using the API

   Configure access on this site (you will need to fill in an access token in the field where it reads "Drop token here ..."), to see
   examples and build your own queries.

   The examples show how to include the access token as a header when calling the API.

   The api is continously expanding with new functionality.
   At the moment not all metadata delivered from the api is correct. This is due to ongoing changes in the underlying data structure, which will last until early 2023.

## Developer tools

A GraphQL server includes an introspectable schema that expresses the capabilities of the API.
This allows for the creation of tools that improve the developer experience.

This site comes with _GraphiQL_,
a graphical interactive GraphQL IDE, which can be used to write and test queries.
All examples come with a simplified inline version of GraphiQL, which can be used as a starting point.
Press `CTRL+SPACE` to autocomplete inside GraphiQL.

Another tool that we included is _Voyager_, which gives a bird's-eye view of the
GraphQL schema. See how different types are connected and zoom in for more details.

## Complexity

When making an API request for data, a complexity value will be computed by considering the query fields.
Certain fields have a higher cost associated with querying them compared to others.

Queries with a complexity value _below 500_ will be classified as <span style={{color: "var(--success-dark)"}}>**simple**</span> queries, while
those _above 500_ will be considered <span style={{color: "var(--warning-dark)"}}>**complex**</span>.

Queries surpassing the _2500_ threshold will be categorized as <span style={{color: "var(--error)"}}>**critical**</span>, indicating a potential decrease in performance.
Such queries will be treated as slow requests, prompting measures to optimize and enhance system responsiveness.

If the complexity value of the query surpasses _25.000_, the query will be **rejected**.

A visualization of the measured query complexity can be found in the bottom right corner of the graphiql query editor.
This visualization live updates as the query changes, giving the developer an idea of the query costs.

The complexity value can be reduced by minimizing the amount of data requested. One approach is to set a lower limit, which can be achieved by implementing pagination/offset functionality.

Other complexity reducements can be attained by breaking down requests to the API into parallel requests and merging the responses on the client-side.
Lazy loading is also an effective method, which defers content loading until necessary, improving performance and reducing initial load times.

## Query Depth

In addition to complexity calculations, a query depth limit has been implemented.
Queries exceeding **15** levels will be rejected to prevent server overloads, mitigate DDOS attacks, and ensure system stability.

## Rate Limiting ðŸš¦

To ensure a stable and fair distribution of resources, we apply rate limiting to our API. Rate limiting restricts the number of requests a client can make within a given time period. This helps protect the API from overload, abuse, and unwanted traffic.

### How does it work?
Each client is identified by a unique ID and assigned a quota for the number of requests allowed within a specific timeframe. If this limit is exceeded, the API will return an error message indicating that too many requests have been sent.

### How to avoid hitting the rate limit?
To ensure smooth operation and avoid disruptions, we recommend implementing some of the following strategies:

- **Caching Responses:** Store frequently requested data locally or in a caching layer to reduce the number of identical API requests.
- **Efficient Querying:** Optimize your API calls by requesting only the data you need. Avoid excessive or unnecessary queries.
- **Batching Requests:** Combine multiple smaller requests into fewer, larger requests where possible.
- **Retry with Backoff:** If your application encounters a rate limit error, implement an exponential backoff strategy to gradually retry requests after a delay.
- **Monitor Usage:** Keep track of how many requests your application makes to detect patterns that could be optimized.

<br />

### Rate Limits and Agreements
The exact rate limit applied to your application may depend on your agreement with DBC DIGITAL. Some clients may have access to higher limits based on their specific needs and usage patterns. If your application requires a higher request quota, please contact us to discuss available options.


## Deprecation

FBI-API is a versionless API, which enables the continuous addition of new types and fields to the API. However, this also means that data models can change, and fields can be renamed, moved, or removed, resulting in breaking changes.

At least three months prior to the final expiration, deprecation warnings will be included in both the documentation and schema.

Deprecation details will include:

- Type and field
- Reason and/or alternative options
- Expiration date

Furthermore, if an entire section in the documentation, with its own heading or subheading, is deprecated, the section title will be flagged deprecated to alert users.

FBI-API ensures that users are informed of any potential deprecations and can smoothly transition to alternative options.

> <DeprecationTitle>ExampleHeading</DeprecationTitle>

Furthermore a deprecation box including detailed information about the deprecation will be shown.

> <DeprecationBox deprecated="01/01-2099" expires="01/01-2100">
>   Some deprecation example ...
> </DeprecationBox>

History for deprecated fields (caused breaking changes) can be found in the [changelog](#Changelog)

## Changelog

The changelog table contains a list of both previous and current deprecated fields that will cause breaking changes to the API. This information enables users to stay informed about any deprecations that may affect their use of the API and take appropriate action to mitigate any potential issues.

## Tracking user interactions

Trace IDs play a crucial role in tracking and linking user actions across API requests.
By including these identifiers, you can connect current user actions to previous ones, providing valuable insights into user behavior.
These insights can help refine and optimize features like search, recommenders, and suggesters.

This guide explains how to include the necessary headers in your API requests and provides practical examples to get you started.

### Request Headers

To enable tracking of user interactions, certain headers must be included in your API requests.
These headers capture essential information such as user consent for tracking, unique visitor identifiers, and trace IDs
that link actions across requests.

#### 1. **`x-tracking-consent`**

Indicates whether the user has given consent for tracking. This header ensures compliance with privacy requirements and determines whether tracking-related headers can be used.

Set to `true` when the user has consented to tracking, otherwise `false`.

#### 2. **`x-session-token`**

A unique identifier for the session. The method for generating this identifier depends on whether the user has given consent for tracking:

- With consent: Generate a UUID and store it in a cookie for persistent identification.
- Without consent: Use a cookieless approach, such as browser fingerprinting, to generate the UUID.

This ensures compliance with user preferences while still enabling actionable analytics.

#### 3. **`x-caused-by`**

The trace ID from a previous request. This header links the current request to its causal chain, enabling better tracking of user interactions.
The trace ID is provided in the response of a prior API call and should be included in subsequent requests to maintain continuity and context.

### Example

The following example demonstrates an API request that includes the required headers and retrieves the traceId and workId for the next request.
One of the traceIds from the response should be used as the x-caused-by in subsequent requests to maintain continuity and link user actions effectively.

```bash
curl -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: bearer ..." \
  -H "x-tracking-consent: true" \
  -H "x-session-token: test-session-token" \
  -H "x-caused-by: test-trace-id" \
  -d '{
    "query": "query Example_SearchWithTrace($q: SearchQueryInput!, $offset: Int!, $limit: PaginationLimitScalar!) {
      search(q: $q) {
        works(offset: $offset, limit: $limit) {
          workId
          traceId
        }
      }
   }",
    "variables": {
      "q": { "all": "test" },
      "offset": 0,
      "limit": 10
    }
  }' \
