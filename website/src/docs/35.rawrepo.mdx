# RawRepo

Handles update requests to MARC records stored in RawRepo.

## Update OVE code

The _updateOveCode_ operation is a service endpoint that inserts or updates an OVE code in a bibliographic record.
Before proceeding, the system verifies that the library is authorized by checking whether `vip.regional_obligations` is set to true.
If not, the operation is denied.

If the record exists, the service ensures that field `032` contains an OVE code by either inserting it or updating it with the OVE code 
and the _agencyId_ associated with the access token used in the API request.

A successful operation returns a enum status code and a confirmation message.
In case of errors (e.g., unknown record), a structured response with error details is returned.

The returned status can be one of following:
<DescribeEnum name="UpdateOveCodeStatusEnum" />

⚠️ If the _dryRun_ argument is set to true. The actual service will never get called, but will return a status "OK".
