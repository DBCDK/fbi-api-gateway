# Get started :coffee:

Welcome to the documentation page of the DBC Gateway.

The API is powered by GraphQL, learn about that [here](https://graphql.org/learn).

On this page you will be able to get an overview of the API. We have included a
bunch of examples, which you can modify right in the browser.

You need to _configure access_ to see the examples, and you will need an access token to do so.
Read on, to learn how to get one.

## How to get access?

Danish libraries can get access. Others have to go through a library to get access.

1. First of all, you need to obtain a _CLIENT_ID_ and _SECRET_ for your application/project

   Send a request via [customer support](https://kundeservice.dbc.dk) including the following information:

   - Project owner (library, email, phone)
   - Technical contact person (name, email, phone)
   - Name and description of application/project

2. Obtain access token

   Get an _anonymous access token_, to access the API on behalf of the application:

   ```
   curl --user "${CLIENT_ID}:${CLIENT_SECRET}" -X POST https://auth.dbc.dk/oauth/token -d "grant_type=password&username=@&password=@"
   ```

   Or get an _authenticated access token_ to access the API on behalf of an end user.

   ```
   curl --user "${CLIENT_ID}:${CLIENT_SECRET}" -X POST https://auth.dbc.dk/oauth/token -d "grant_type=password&username=${USERNAME}&password=${PASSWORD}"
   ```

   `${USERNAME}` is Loanernumber@library-agencyId and `${PASSWORD}` is the loaners pincode.

3. Begin using the API

   Configure access on this site (you need to fill in an access token), to see
   examples and build your own queries.

   The examples show how to include the access token as a header when calling the API.

## Developer tools

A GraphQL server includes an introspectable schema that expresses the capabilities of the API.
This allows for the creation of tools that improve the developer experience.

This site comes with _GraphiQL_,
a graphical interactive GraphQL IDE, which can be used to write and test queries.
All examples comes with a simplified inline version of GraphiQL, which can be used as a starting point.
Press `CTRL+SPACE` to autocomplete inside GraphiQL.

Another tool that we included is _Voyager_, which gives a bird's-eye view of the
GraphQL schema. See how different types are connected, and zoom in for more details.
