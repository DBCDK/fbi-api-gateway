# LinkCheck

## Checks

Validates a given list of urls, by returning an individual url `status`. Urls known by the service will return a cached status. Cached statuses are continuously checked on new requests.

The returned _status_ can be one of the following:

- _**OK**_ - Reflects HTTP status 1xx, 2xx and 3xx
- _**BROKEN**_ - Reflects status 4xx and 5xx
- _**GONE**_ - An url has been _BROKEN_ for more than 5 days
- _**INVALID**_ - Not a valid url

The field `brokenSince` will return a timestamp for when the link was first marked as _BROKEN_ or _GONE_. The `lastCheckedAt` field, will return a timestamp for when the url was last checked.
