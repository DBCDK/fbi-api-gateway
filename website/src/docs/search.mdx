# Search

The following examples show how to search for bibliographic works.

## A Basic Example

A search request takes a query string as input and returns a list of works.
In this simple example we search for _harry_ and ask for work titles to be returned.
Note how _all_ in the query object is used to hold the query string. This is
useful where one does not know if the query matches a title, crator or subject.

<InlineGraphiQL
  query={`query ($q: SearchQuery!, $offset: Int!, $limit: PaginationLimit!) {
      search(q: $q) {
        works(offset: $offset, limit: $limit) {
          title
        }
      }
    }`}
  variables={{ q: { all: "harry" }, offset: 0, limit: 10 }}
/>

## Pagination

In the example above only 10 works are returned, but what if we want to browse the entire search
result?

For this purpose one needs to get the _hitcount_ indicating the total number of works in the result, and
to send _offset_ and _limit_ which specify some slice of the result to be returned.

If one wants to show 10 works per page the limit is set to 10 (the max limit size is 100). The first
page is selected by setting offset to 0, the second page by setting offset to 10 and so on.
The total number of pages is calculated by dividing hitcount with limit.

The example below returns the second page of the search result.

<InlineGraphiQL
  query={`query ($q: SearchQuery!, $offset: Int!, $limit: PaginationLimit!) {
      search(q: $q) {
        hitcount
        works(offset: $offset, limit: $limit) {
          title
        }
      }
    }`}
  variables={{ q: { all: "harry" }, offset: 10, limit: 10 }}
/>

## Search For Title, Creator, and Subject

When it is known in advance that the search string is a title, creator or a subject,
it may be specified in the query object _q_. Combinations are possible as well, for instance
implemented in the UI with multiple input fields.

This examples searches for _hopper_ as title, _hesteavl_ as subject, and _carl_ as creator.

<InlineGraphiQL
  query={`query ($q: SearchQuery!, $offset: Int!, $limit: PaginationLimit!) {
    search(q: $q) {
      hitcount
      works(offset: $offset, limit: $limit) {
        title
        creators {
          name
        }
        subjects {
          type
          value
        }
      }
    }
  }`}
  variables={{
    q: { title: "hopper", subject: "hesteavl", creator: "carl" },
    offset: 0,
    limit: 10,
  }}
/>

## Faceted Search and Filters

Faceted search seeks to provide an improved overview by clustering the search result into
categories. This allows for the user to incrementally customize and narrow down the search result.

The following example is a search for _andersen_ where facet categories _language_ and _materialType_
is returned.

<InlineGraphiQL
  query={`query ($q: SearchQuery!, $facets: [FacetField!]!, $facetLimit: Int!) {
      search(q: $q) {
        hitcount
        facets(facets: $facets) {
          name
          values(limit: $facetLimit) {
            term
            count
          }
        }
      }
    }`}
  variables={{
    q: {
      all: "harry",
    },
    facetLimit: 5,
    facets: ["language", "materialType"],
  }}
/>

Then the term of the facet can be used as a filter. In this example, a language filter
is applied resulting in an updated facet result.

<InlineGraphiQL
  query={`query ($q: SearchQuery!, $facets: [FacetField!]!, $facetLimit: Int!, $filters: SearchFilters!) {
      search(q: $q, filters: $filters) {
        hitcount
        facets(facets: $facets) {
          name
          values(limit: $facetLimit) {
            term
            count
          }
        }
      }
    }`}
  variables={{
    q: {
      all: "harry",
    },
    filters: { language: ["Svensk"] },
    facetLimit: 5,
    facets: ["language", "materialType"],
  }}
/>

If multiple filters are added for the same category, they are OR'ed together.
For instance, works must be Svensk OR Engelsk. Filters applied across categories
are AND'ed together. For instance (Svensk OR Engelsk) AND dvd.

## Facet performance

While it is possible to fetch both facets and works in a single request, it is not recommended.
Compared to getting the works, facets are more expensive to generate.

Split the search for works and facets into two requests and send them in parallel. Then the works
can be shown to the user as quickly as possible.
